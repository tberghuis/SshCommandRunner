port forwarding

connect details

  private key (file picker)
    passphrase

find reference project f-droid

check if port forwarding possible with library
prototype in compose desktop app

tmp package
manifest xml
  fresh service, activity
  hardcode 1 feature at a time
  invoke adb cli commands.txt (service intent)

check v1.1.0 crash report
  scope ssh connection lifetime to viewmodel
  

1 hardcode port forward qbittorrent
1. service
... bind
... button run fuction

during dev hardcode ssh password
https://github.com/google/secrets-gradle-plugin
  remove from build.gradle after finish dev
  

https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj
learn from each example code, by implementing mvp hardcode


next task, button to disconnect

test emulator foreground service older apilevels

add actions to foreground notification, 
  hangup/disconnect, meh
  view output, default action when tap notification

mvp
  1. rewrite same functionality as now, except foreground service
      single ssh connection at a time

    [ ] local port forward
        local host:
        local port:
        remote host:
        remote port:

room migration add port forward to command
  write tests???


buy testing course PL...

t. button hangup

// doitwrong
run command, if command already
  if SshController != null
    if command id != running command id
      hangup
  runCommand    

tests.txt
write list of user actions
come up with permutations that could be problematic
PL testing course
